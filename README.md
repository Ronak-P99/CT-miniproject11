Project Requirements
Data Organization with Lists and Dictionaries:
Implement operations for managing playlists & songs.
Provide functionalities to add songs and create playlists
Ensure effective storage and retrieval of playlist information. We learned about a lot of algorithms to help efficiently manage these things. What might be useful to implement this? 
Efficient Search and Sort Algorithms for Playlist Navigation:
Implement a search and sort algorithm for finding a song or sorting songs based off name, artist, or genre.
Analyze the time complexity and performance trade-offs of search and sort algorithms in playlist management.
Building a Flask API for Playlist Access and Management:
Implement CRUD endpoints using Flask for managing playlists and songs.


How to Use:
Use Postman to GET, POST, DELETE all songs and playlists. To add a song, you will need a title, genre, and artist. To make a playlist, you will just need a playlist name.
Must add song to playlist manually through playlist on postman once created. Deleting just needs the name of the song and name of PLaylist. Enjoy the experience!
